# 🧪 MCP Lab – Experiments with Anthropic's Model Context Protocol

Welcome to **MCP Lab**, a collection of projects, demos, and experiments using Model Context Protocol (MCP). This repository serves as a playground to explore the power and versatility of MCP in connecting AI models to external tools, data sources, and services.

> Think of MCP as **USB-C for AI** – a standardized way to plug large language models (LLMs) into your tools with minimal custom code.

## 📂 Structure

Each folder in this repo represents an independent, self-contained project or tutorial built using MCP. Projects vary from beginner-friendly crash courses to deeper integrations with real-world APIs and local infrastructure.

```bash
mcp-lab/
│
├── mcp-crash-course/         # Introductory project – walk-through of MCP basics
├── Coming soon...
```

Each project includes:
- Clear setup instructions
- Source code for MCP servers and/or clients
- Examples or video walkthroughs
- Optional Claude or local LLM integration

## 🧠 Why MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables:
- 🔌 **Plug-and-play integrations** between LLMs and external tools
- 🔒 **Privacy-aware, local-first design** (no need to expose your data to the cloud)
- 🧱 **Composable, reusable servers** for Slack, GitHub, databases, and more
- 🌐 **LLM-agnostic architecture** (works with Claude, Ollama, ChatGPT, etc.)

With MCP, you write a connector **once**, and any compatible model can use it. It’s the future of LLM-to-tool communication.
